        <p> sometime did not really keep one from going on, it was nothing that interfered, it was only something that happened, and as it happened as a perfectly natural happening, I did not believe in <mark>periods</mark>  and I used them<mark>.</mark></p>

        <p>They could begin to act as they thought best and one might interrupt one’s writing with them that is not really interrupt one’s writing with them but one could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in one’s writing and so they could be used and you could use them <mark>periods</mark>  could come to exist in this way and they could come in this way to have a life of their own<mark>.</mark></p>
